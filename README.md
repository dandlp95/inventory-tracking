# Overview

Through this application I could learn how web applications and interact with the frontend to create a dynamic page where a user can comunicate with a database. 

{Provide a description the web app that you wrote. Describe how to start a test server on your computer and what website to open up to see the first page of the app.}

In order to make my website easier to run, I did some research on how to deploy both the frontend and the backend as 1 project. So, I decided to deploy in Heroku. To access the application, simply go to this link: https://inv-tracking-dlp.herokuapp.com/

If you would like to run the application in your computer's local host, you can go to the root folder and enter npm run start to initiate the server. Once that happens, go to the client folder and type npm run start.

I wrote this software to learn full-stack, as I also implemented react for the frontend, which is a great technology for a more interactive web app, rather than vanilla html/css/js.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages

There is only 1 page, but the components  that gets rendered in the page change depending on what you want to do. 

The options component will show 3 options, one to have all the products displayed.From there, you can click on  each product to delete it, edit it or add stock to a warehouse.

By clicking in warehouses, the warehouses component gets rendered and the user will see all the warehouses in the database. Each warehouse will also have the option to see its inventory.

Finally, the third option is a form to add a new warehouse to the database.

# Development Environment

The tools I used were Node.js and React.js. I used many modules as well such as express, mongoose, react-router-dom, nodemon, dotenv and cors.

The main languages used were Javascript and HTML/CSS.
